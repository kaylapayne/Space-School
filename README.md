# Space-School
This repository contains the content for the 2021/2022 Space School year.

## Goal
The goal of Space School is to provide new members to QSET with the necessary skills to be an effective member of the team in the scope of 12 weeks. If you complete Space School, which encompasse completeing the labs in this repository and attending the weekly Space School meetings, you will create a toast satellite (toastSat), named for its toast like shape. Your toastSat will be launched on a high altitude balloon in the winter semester. The skills gained here are the basis for what you will need to know when you are working on our 3U cube satellite. üõ∞Ô∏è

Please note that you require **NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE** and we are here to support you on your entine toastSat building journey. 

## Skills gained
By the end of Space School you will gain experience in the following areas:

- Technical skills
  - LAUNCHING SOMETHING INTO THE STRATOSPHERE :rocket:
  - Coding in C/C++
  - Arduino
  - CAD
  - 3D printing
  - Soldering
  - Experience using microcontrollers
  - Experience developing basic circuits
  - Data sheets
  - Working within design constraints
- Team based skills
  - Understanding of the satellite subsystems
  - Intro to space engineering
  - Get to know all the amazing people we have on the team üôÇ
