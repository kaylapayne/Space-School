# Goals of Lab 2

1️⃣  Learn how to strip a wire.

2️⃣  Read values from a temperature sensor on your Arduino.

3️⃣  Understand the basics and benefits of GitHub. Start your first repository and upload your code.

## Stripping Wires

Today we're starting with a quick demonstration on how to strip wires using wire strippers. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZFTKbT4XFs) is a video tutorial for those who could not make the lab. This will be useful for when you start doing more circuit work and need more wires.

## Using GitHub

GitHub. Is. Amazing. Become friends with it now, and you can thank me later:) 

Here are some reasons GitHub is amazing:
- it stores your code online so you can access it from anywhere and easily collaborate with others.
- it allows for version control.
- it is a REALLY great thing to have for your resume. You can think of it as a personal portfolio of projects you have worked on. (We'll be adding your first one today!)
- it has tons of project management features (Issues, Tasks, etc.).

Some important definitions:
- **GitHub:** is an Internet hosting service for software development and version control. It provides the version control of Git plus access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
- **Git:** software for version control: tracking changes in files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code.
- **Markdown:** a language that uses plain text formatting but contains inline text symbols that specify how to format the text. ".md" indicates that a file is written with markdown. Think of it as a fancy text file!
- **ReadMe:** a ReadMe file contains information about the other files in the directory. It is usually a plain text file called readme.md.
- **Repository:** a repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history. You can think of it as a folder.
- **Branch:** branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository. Each repository has one default branch, and can have multiple other branches. How many branches does this repository have?
- **Commit:** You can save small groups of meaningful changes as commits. Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies the specific changes, when the changes were made, and who created the changes.

We are not going to be using GitHub to it's full potential in Space School; we just want you to get familiar with the UI and start a repository. However, if you are interested in learning more, here are some useful and quick tutorials:
