# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the 10th lab of Space School! In this lab will outline the requirements for the ToastSat structure you will be working on in the following two weeks. It should be noted that this lab is going to be structured differently than those in the past.  Instead of the usual format that resembles the steps needed for completion, you could think of lab 10 as an assignment.  We will outline what you are trying to accomplish, a definition of done as well as the information we believe is necessary to complete this "assignment".  Due to the midterm schedule the first week working on this will be done on your team's own time. 

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to Emma Paczkowski, Sean Tedesco, Piper Steffen, Thomas Sears, or any other member of the QSAT Team (especially the mech team). Contact info can be found in the [readme](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/Space-School) of this repository. 

## Summary
Thus far in our ToastSat journey each team has selected a sensor suite that has been used to create their payload which encompases both the arduino software and circuitry. There remain a few steps between where we are currently and launching the balloon. One, is that we need to talk to circuitry you have created on the breadboards and transfer it to a proto board. Two, we need to create a structure to hold all our pieces together. In an ideal world we would have done the steps in the above order, however, due to the pandemic we are creating the structure first. 

To build your design you will need to use some sort of CAD software.  You are welcome to use whichever software you wish, however, the team is most familiar with SOLIDWORKS. We are assuming that for those of you that are in first year, you would have downloaded SOLIDWORKS and received a license.  If you do not have access to SOLIDWORKS through school, please message Emma and she will provide the instructions to get a license through the design team.

## Information

### Assumptions to make
- The balloon gondola will be a styrofoam box that you will place your toastSat inside along with the other team's toastSats.
- A Lithium polymer battery will be included in your design to power the ToastSat.
- The Arduino and sensors are going to be soldered to a proto board and resemble the following schematic:

### Part Dimensions
- Protoboard:
  - 5cm x 7cm x 0.16cm (length x width x height)
  - Hole Diameter: 2mm
  - Lengthwise mounting hole distance: 66mm
  - Widthwise mounting hole distance: ~46.4mm

## Definition of Done
A completed toast sat structure will abide by the following acceptance criteria:
- The CAD model is within its allocated mass as defined in the teams mass budget.
- The CAD model includes an attachment mechanism to the balloon gondola.
- The CAD model is within a 10*10*10cm volume.
- The CAD model keeps all components of your design secure throughout the duration of the flight.
- The stl file has been emailed to emma.paczkowski@queensu.ca for printing!
