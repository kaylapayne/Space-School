# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the 12th lab of Space School! This lab will showcase the steps to soldering your payload. Each one of your toastSats will be slightly different, but this lab will cover some design considerations that you can use while undertaking your own soldering work.

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to Emma Paczkowski, Sean Tedesco, Piper Steffen, Thomas Sears, or any other member of the QSAT Team (especially the mech team). Contact info can be found in the [readme](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/Space-School) of this repository.
