# Introduction

Hello! Welcome to the 13th lab of Space School! In this lab we will work towards the final assemebly of the toastSat structure. We take all the pieces we have built these last few sessions, assemble them, and perform full system verification tests to ensure our toastSats are ready for flight! 

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to Emma Paczkowski, Sean Tedesco, Piper Steffen, Thomas Sears, or any other member of the QSAT Team (especially the mech team).
