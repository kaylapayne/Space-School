# Introduction 

# Goals of Lab 3 

1️⃣ Practice writing your own code and building your own hardware setup. 

2️⃣ Store data we collect onto an SD card. 

3️⃣ Learn about the software libraries Arduino has to offer and how to use them. 

4️⃣ Consider the imposed constraints on the payload to begin designing your sensor suite.
