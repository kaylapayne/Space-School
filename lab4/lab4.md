## 3.1 üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- **Pin + (VDD):** This is the power connection to the sensor. Needs to be connected to 3.3 volt power supply. (On the Arduino Uno/Nano: 3V3)
- **Pin - (GND):** This is the ground connection to the sensor. Needs to be connected to the ground of the power supply. (On the Arduino Uno/Nano: GND) 
- **Pin DA (SDA):** This is the I2C data communication line. Needs to be connected to any pin labeled SDA. (On the Arduino Uno/Nano: A4) 
- **Pin CL (SCL):** This is the I2C clock communication line. Neends to be connected to any pin labelled SCL. (On the Arduino Uno/Nano: A5) 
- **Pin IO (VDDIO):** This is the input/output voltage control line. Leave this disconnected unless you're connecting to a lower-voltage microprocessor. 

## 3.2 üíª  Software Requirements
To easily communicate with this sesnor we can use a pre-written library. Libraries are collections of software functions geared towards a single purpose, such as communicating with a specific device. Fortunately there is a pre-written Arduino library called SFE_BMP180 that allows you to easily talk to the BMP180 sensor. This library is not included with the stock Arduino software, but don't worry, installing new libraries is easy.

1. Follow this link: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/bmp180-barometric-pressure-sensor-hookup-/all#res
2. Follow the instructions in the **_Installing the Arduino Library_** section. 
3. Open any example sketch from _File > Examples > Examples from Custom Libraries_ 
4. Compile the sketch to verify that the software is working correctly. 

Notes About Using the BMP180 Library.
- You must first get a temperature measurement to perform a pressure reading.
- Using the .startTemperature() and .startPressure() methods returns the time required to wait before using the .getTemperature() and .getPressure() methods. 
- The .getTemperature() and .getPressure() methods return 0 if the measurement failed, or 1 if successful. 
- The pressure sensor returns abolute pressure with .getPressure(), which varies with altitude. To remove the effects of altitude, use the sealevel function and your current altitude.

## 3.3 Example

```
#include <SFE_BMP180.h>
#include <Wire.h>

#define ALTITUDE 1655.0 

SFE_BMP180 pressure_sensor;

void setup()
{
    // start up the pressure sensor 
    pressure_sensor.begin(); 
}

void loop()
{
    char status;
    double T,P,p0,a;
    
    // You must first get a temperature measurement to perform a pressure reading.
    status = pressure.startTemperature();
    delay(status);
    
    // Retrieve the completed temperature measurement, measurement is stored in the variable T.
    status = pressure.getTemperature(T);
    
    // Start a pressure measurement: the parameter is the oversampling setting, from 0 to 3 (highest res, longest wait).
    status = pressure.startPressure(3);
    delay(status);
    
    // Retrieve the completed pressure measurement, measurement is stored in the variable P.
    status = pressure.getPressure(P,T);
    
    // Retrieve the relative (sea-level) pressure, measurement is stored in the variable p0. 
    p0 = pressure.sealevel(P, ALTITUDE);
    
    // Retreive the current altitude from the pressure reading
    a = pressure.altitude(P,p0);
    
    // include a delay to not overwork the sensor
    delay(5000); 
}
```

The TMP35/TMP36/TMP37 are low voltage, precision centigrade temperature sensors. They provide a voltage output that is linearly proportional to the Celsius (centigrade) temperature. The TMP35/ TMP36/TMP37 do not require any external calibration to provide typical accuracies of ¬±1¬∞C at +25¬∞C and ¬±2¬∞C over the ‚àí40¬∞C to +125¬∞C temperature range. **[Datasheet](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/assets/assets/000/010/131/original/TMP35_36_37.pdf)**

## 5.1 üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- The TMP36 is specified from ‚àí40¬∞C to +125¬∞C, provides a 750 mV output at 25¬∞C. 
- Analog Signal Ouput 

## 5.2 üíª Software Requirements
- Analog to Digital Conversion : Digial Voltage Value = Analog Input Voltage * Input Voltage / 1024.0  
- Conversion Factor: Temperate C = [Vout in mV - 500mV] / (10mV / 1 ¬∞C)

## 5.3 Example

```

## 6.1 Hardware Requirements
### Pinouts üìå

  -  Power Pins
      - **3V** - This is the power pin. MicroSD cards must use 3.3V, so take care to only hook 3.3V to this pin. Hooking 5V or VBAT to this pin will damage your microSD card.
     - **GND** - common ground for power and logic.
  - Common Logic Pins
    - **DET** - Detect whether a microSD card is inserted. This pin is connected to **GND** internally when there's no card, but when one is inserted it is pulled up to **3V** with a 4.7k‚Ñ¶ resistor. That means that when the pin's logic level is **False** there's no card and when it's **True** there is.
   - SPI Logic Pins
     If you're using SPI to connect to your SD cards, the pins have the following functions:
      - **CLK** - This is the SPI **C**lock pin /** SCK** **S**erial **C**lock, its an input to the chip.
      - **SO** - this is the **S**erial **O**ut / **M**icrocontroller **I**n **S**erial **O**ut pin, for data sent from the SD card to your processor.
       - **SI** - this is the **S**erial **I**n / **M**icrocontroller **O**ut **S**erial **I**n pin, for data sent from your processor to the SD card. Its an input to the chip and can use 3V logic only.
      - **CS** - this is the **C**hip **S**elect pin, drop it low to start an SPI transaction. Its an input to the chip and can use 3V logic only.
Pull ups are provided on all SPI logic pin.

- SDIO Logic Pins     
If you're using SDIO to connect to your SD cards, the pins have the following functions:      
    - **CLK** - The SDIO clock pin. A clock signal is sent by the microcontroller to the SD card on this pin.   
    - **CMD**  - A bidirectional pin for communication between the microcontroller and the SD card, used for commands and information.   
    - **4 Data pins**  - Four bidirectional pins for communication between the microcontroller and the SD card, used for transferring bulk data. Take care to wire these in the correct order! The silk screen legends read: **D0, D1, DAT2, D3**. 

Pull ups are provided on all SDIO logic pins.
Note that when inserted, the SD card extends slightly beyond the edge of the PCB. 

## 6.2 Software Requirements
You will need to import 2 libraries. To import a library, in the Arduino IDE go to -> Sketch -> Include Libraries -> (library name)

- Import the **SPI** library. Note that an Arduino board only has 2 SPI connections.
- Import the **SD** card library.

## 6.3 Example
```
/*
  SD card read/write

  This example shows how to read and write data to and from an SD card file
  The circuit:
   SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11
 ** MISO - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - pin 4 (for MKRZero SD: SDCARD_SS_PIN)

  This example code is in the public domain.

File myFile;

void setup() {
  // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial) {
    ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
  }


  Serial.print("Initializing SD card...");

  if (!SD.begin(4)) {
    Serial.println("initialization failed!");
    while (1);
  }
  Serial.println("initialization done.");

  // open the file. note that only one file can be open at a time,
  // so you have to close this one before opening another.
  myFile = SD.open("test.txt", FILE_WRITE);

  // if the file opened properly, write to it:
  if (myFile) {
    Serial.print("Writing to test.txt...");
    myFile.println("testing 1, 2, 3.");
    // close the file:
    myFile.close();
    Serial.println("done.");
  } else {
    // if the file didn't open, print an error:
    Serial.println("error opening test.txt");
  }

  // re-open the file for reading:
  myFile = SD.open("test.txt");
  if (myFile) {
    Serial.println("test.txt:");

    // read from the file until there's nothing else in it:
    while (myFile.available()) {
      Serial.write(myFile.read());
    }

    myFile.close();
