# Introduction 
Hello! Welcome to the fourth lab (part c) of Space School! In this lab we are going to focus on the goals for the remainder of the semester which include finishing the payload software, creating a wiring diagram and preparing for your end of semester presentation for the full team meeting on November 29th. With school getting busier towards the end of the semester and only having two weeks of space school left we have rejigged the format and moved soldering to the second semester.  Please see the [readme](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/Space-School) of this repository for the updated schedule. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Emma Paczkowski, Sean Tedesco, Piper Steffen, Thomas Sears, or any other member of the QSAT Team. Contact info can be found in the [readme](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/Space-School) of this repository. 

# Goals of Lab 4 B / The rest of the semester
1️⃣ Finish payload software.  
2️⃣ Create wiring diagram.  
3️⃣ Prepare for end of semester presentation.  


# 1 - Finish Payload Software
Are you done with your payload software?
- **NO**
  - Please use the previous labs as reference for completing your payload software.
  - Please ask questions if you need assistance weather that be during the Space School session or not.
- **YES**
  - **Complete this checklist**:  
   [] The code compiles.  
   [] The code successfully uploads to the board.  
   [] The Values that I am getting make sense.  
  **Stretch Goal Checklist**:  
   [] Get a code review from someone on the team to see if there are ways to improve your code and make it more efficient.  
   [] Upload your code to a GitHub repository.   

# 2 - Create Wiring Diagram
When we come back from winter break we are going to jump into soldering and creating a wiring diagram will facilitate this process.
### What is a wiring diagram?
A wiring diagram is a simple visual representation of the physical connections and physical layout of an electrical system or circuit. It shows how the electrical wires are interconnected and can also show where sensors and components are connected to the system. With this diagram you should be able to answer questions such as which pins on the arduino do I connect my temperature sensor to? or what value is the resistor for my LED?
### How can you create a wiring diagram?
1. **Pick your Tool**: There are many tools you can use to create a wiring diagram. In the past the team has used Draw.io as it is easy to collaborate but feel free to find other tools or even draw it on a piece of paper. 
2. **Know your Symbols**: There are specific symbols that correlate to certain electric components such as resistors and LEDs. Make sure you are using the correct symbols to match the components you are using. For your Arduino and Sensors, since there is no predefined symbol, I would suggest you make a box and label the inputs/outputs they have.

# 3 - Prepare for end of Semester Presentation
The team is holding a [full team meeting November 29 7:30pm - 8:30pm on teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a228819f05c6048ba9648b700fe70780f%40thread.tacv2/1636333553327?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22d61ecb3b-38b1-42d5-82c4-efb2838b925c%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22435b5691-4e74-41b9-bf46-569822016814%22%7d) to give everyone an update as to what the team has been upto and showcase the work members have been working on.  In this meeting we would like to give your team a chance to showcase the incredible work you have been doing this semester in Space School in the format of a "3-2-1 presentation". What that means is that we are asking you to create **3** slides, present for **2** minutes and answer **1** minute of questions.  This is optional but highly encouraged.

### Goals of the presentation
- Introduce yourself to the team
- Talk about what you have done/learnt in Space School
- Have fun! This is not a serious presentation.
