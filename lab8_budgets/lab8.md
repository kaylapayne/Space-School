# Introduction 
And we're back! Welcome to the eigth lab of Space School! We all hope you had an amazing holiday break, but now it is time for some more Space School. In this lab we are going to focus on a topic in engineering called `budgets`! These are extremely useful tools for engineers to characterize their space missions and start appling some real numbers to their mission design. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Emma Paczkowski, Sean Tedesco, Piper Steffen, Thomas Sears, or any other member of the QSAT Team. Contact info can be found in the [readme](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/Space-School) of this repository. 

# Goals of Lab 8

1Ô∏è‚É£ Learn what budgets are. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Learn what budgets are included in spacecraft systems and how they are used.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ Begin working on your toastSat budgets. 

# Section 1: Budget Overview üìñ

## What is a budget? 

## What budgets are typically found on spacescraft? 

## What budgets are to be included for out toastSats and why? 

# Section 2: toastSat Mass Budget üèãÔ∏è
Now that we have learned some of the ins and outs of spacecraft budgets, we are going to make the first budget for our toastSats. The goal for this section is to create your **mass budget**. Once teams are finished with their budgets, we hope to share them to the rest of Space School next session and highlight the creativity you can have with creating your budgets!  

## 2.1 Helpful Style Guides
While budgets are tools that engineers use to characterize their systems and missions, they are also documents that are _alive_, read by many team members, and iterated upon. As such, a budget should be able to read for team members from different backgrounds, and be able to be easily used. Below are some helpful pointers for you to think about while attempting to create your budgets. 

1. Budgets ask and answer the question: "Given these inputs, what are the ouputs?", so how may we highlight these two important properties?
1. Budgets may contain considerations and calculations that go into budgets, how may we share the justification that went into these?
1. Budgets may contain unknown symbols and colors, how may we provide an easy to read way for users to understand the meaning of these symbols and colors? 
1. Budgets may contain many numerical values, how may we differentiate and give context to these values from one another?  
1. Budgets may contain parameters with a level of uncertianty, how may we include this level of uncertianty? 

## 2.2 Additional Mass Budget Information 
The target mass of your toastSat is 100 grams. This include all of the components outlined in the image below (electrical components, protoboard, structure, and wired connection to the "Toaster" power system).
