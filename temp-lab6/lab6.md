Hello! Welcome to the sixth lab of Space School! In this lab we will show an example of a toastSat payload prototype. We will talk about some of the hardware features it has, and read through the software associated with this prototype. While reviewing our build and software we will identify any areas of improvement, implementing them along the way. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Emma Paczkowski, Sean Tedesco, Piper Steffen, Thomas Sears, or any other member of the QSAT Team. Contact info can be found in the [readme](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/Space-School) of this repository.
